# Python_EDGE_Course_Project

This project was developed to determine Bangla speech emotion recognition using Deep Learning model. The model architecture was developed using CNN architecture where multi level audio features like ZCR,STFT,MFCC,mel-spectrogram,RMS energy were extracted.This model was trained using SUBESCO dataset. Emotions were detected for seven different level with an accuracy of more than 92%
